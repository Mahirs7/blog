summary: 'Why I created this blog and what you can expect.'
---

I created this blog to serve as a repository for my thoughts. I'm not sure what constitutes a good blog; nor do I know how to create an immersive digital experience for readers and captivate them with my words. However, I love sharing my thoughts, and I hope to get better at expressing myself digitally through this journey.

## What can you expect?

I love computer science and technology. I don't want to make this a "tech blog", and I doubt it will be like other tech blogs, but I do plan on primarily writing about various fields of computer science and technology, my journey in CS at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and how technology intersects with some of my other passions. Some fields of CS include artificial intelligence, software development, and CS education. As a student myself, I find discourse on CS education very interesting and very important. I also plan on writing about life in general like my experience at the UofI or about my passions.

## Website Innovations

In the near future I want to implement changes to this site to make the experience even better. I plan on adding some UI components
