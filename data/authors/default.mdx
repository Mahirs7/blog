Hey! I'm Mahir Sabharwal, a Math and CS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Welcome to my website!

I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a keen interest in generative AI and quantitative finance. I am passionate about building cool things that impact people. I enjoy writing about my projects and general thoughts I have about technology.

I am currently working at GamePlay, a sports scheduling startup in California, as a full stack software engineer intern. Here, I primarily work with C#, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. As a full stack engineer, I work both on the frontend and backend, and also collaborated with the data science team. On the frontend, I enhanced the UI by developing auto-complete driven search components by leveraging the Google Maps API. On the backend, I built a robust system that automates the data collection of all sports facilities in the United States. I also architected databases, and wrote SQL and Python scripts to retrieve and process information more efficiently.

Along with Math and Computer Science, I'm also passionate about sports and music, and I'm fascinated by the intersection of data and technology in these fields.
