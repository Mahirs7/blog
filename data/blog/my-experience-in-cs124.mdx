summary: 'My thoughts on CS124, the first computer science class at Illinois.'

In my first semester at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, I took the first computer science class in the core sequence - CS124 or "Intro to Computer Science".

## Course Description

[CS124](https://www.cs124.org) is an introductory programming class offered in Java and Kotlin. It is taught by [Professor. Challen](https://www.geoffreychallen.com) and it's an extremely unique course. Some of the objectives of CS124 are:

- Teach students how to design and develop algorithms to solve problems
- Teach students how to use and analyze data structures and algorithms to use them for data storage and problem solving
- Teach students core software design concepts like Object Oriented Programming
- Teach students how to write and debug small Java/Kotlin programs

## Course Design

I said this course is unique. Here's why. The entire course is right [here](https://www.cs124.org). The course is set up on a single website. There are no in person lectures or discussions. All content delivery is done through interactive code walkthroughs, videos, written content and code playgrounds on the website.

One might have mixed feelings about this. Afterall, you're paying a large sum of tuition money for a class you don't attend. Over the semester, I've found this set up to work well in many cases, and also fail in some.

## Pros of the Course Design

CS124 emphasizes learning by doing. Programming is a skill and to get better at it, you must do it. A lot. The CS124 website has intercative code walkthroughs, where an instructor is explaing a concept while programming live in a coding playground. You have the ability to pause the walkthrough at any time and actually change and compile the code. Code walkthroughs in an interactive playground are far better than video lectures and presentations. I felt this feature particulary is a big reason why in person lectures _may_ not be needed for CS124.

Each lesson has several coding problems that complement the written material and walkthroughs. If you do most, if not all, practice problems, the concepts start making more sense and you become proficient at writing code associated to those concepts. All coding problems on the site have an autograder functionality, which is very helpful. Your code gets compiled and tested immediately and you recieve instant feedback.

The playgrounds are custom made. This allows instructors and students to write code without having to worry about all the boilerplate Java code. You can write the following, and it will run on the browser. No need to worry about extra lines of code that probably aren't as meaningful to a new programmer.

```java
System.out.println("Hello world");
```

Since the course is on a single site and has coding features, you can write code on on your browser. This is helpful because it eliminates the need for downloading IDEs, which come with all sorts of problems for people with all sorts of devices. (We did end up having to download Andorid Studio... not the best experience)

There's a help site too. If you get stuck, you can go to the help page on the site and get tutored by course staff. This allows for students getting help quicker and more conviniently.

Overall, the site is pretty damn good. The UI is elegant and intuitive, the UX is smooth, and the functionality and features are really, really good. Seriously, the CS124 has been engineered extremely well. It's very challenging to build something like this. There's a lot of microservices in the backend that all make a big impact on the site. The site also performs quite well, considering over a 1000 students use this site at once.

## Cons of the Course Design

Now coming to the cons. While the CS124 site is really good, having the entire delivery online has drawbacks. It felt different; at some points during the semester I stopped grouping CS124 with my other _normal_ classes. In person course activities are important to ensure student engagement.
