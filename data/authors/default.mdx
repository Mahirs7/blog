Hi there, this is Mahir Sabharwal, a math and CS student at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. Welcome to my blog!

I write about various computer science fields like technology, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and CS education. Some of my other passions include sports and music, and I write about the intersection of technology and these fields. I also write about CS @ UIUC and my college experience.
